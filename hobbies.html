                    <h2>Manga</h2>
                    <p>During my college days, my time was mostly spent on projects, reviews, and other academic tasks so I don't really have much time for leisure. I can only get a breather when traveling from home to school and vice versa, during lunch breaks, and before going to bed. Reading manga helped me a lot in getting the fun that I needed during these free times. Whenever there's an opportunity to sit down and rest for a while, I immediately grab my phone and read some saved manga. Now, after getting a stable job, I took this hobby to the next level and started buying hard copies from the nearest bookstores.</p>

                    <h2>Gaming</h2>
                    <p>This hobby of mine goes way back when I was in high school. A friend introduced the game "Defense of the Ancients", or what's most popularly known as DotA, to me during our free time after school. Since then, I became attached to a lot of online games, be it roleplaying or first-person shooter games. I even bought my own PC so that I can play my favorite games instead of going to internet cafes and rent their PCs for just a few hours.</p>

                    <h2>Netflix</h2>
                    <p>Due to the pandemic, a lot of people got stuck inside their homes and that includes me. Last March 2020, the company that I'm working with decided to offer a work-from-home setup so as to lessen the spread of COVID-19 in our workplace. At first I was happy about this decision since I will no longer need to commute everyday. However, as time passed by, I felt the boredom from having too much free time so this was when I decided to subscribe to Netflix. Until now, Netflix still helps me relieve a lot of stress from work. I even share this hobby with my partner whenever we're on our day off.</p>
